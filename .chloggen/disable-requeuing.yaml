  The current re-enqueuing behavior is not obvious and cannot be configured. It takes place only for persistent queue
  and only if `retry_on_failure::enabled=true` even if `retry_on_failure` is a setting for a different backoff retry
  strategy. This change removes the re-enqueuing behavior. Consider increasing `retry_on_failure::max_elapsed_time` 
  to reduce chances of data loss or set it to 0 to keep retrying until requests succeed.

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
